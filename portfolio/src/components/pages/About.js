    to gain as much knowledge as possible. Driven, passionate, resourceful, witty, strategic, honest; just some of the
    words that describe me. Mainly, kind and helpful. I have always enjoyed working with computers, whether it was
    playing games, writing, reading, learning, teaching, manipulating, researching, I have always enjoyed the concept of
    a world connected. Wanting to be a bigger part of that world, I have started taking steps to achieve my newest goal:
    <span class="lightgreen">Coder/Programmer/Developer!</span></p>
    <p>My plan to achieve this
    starts with the <span class="skyblue">Coding Bootcamp</span> at <span
      class="skyblue">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</span>.</p>
